The Focus of this work is on the independent task assignment problem which often occurs in applications related to heterogeneous computing system. For heterogeneous computing systems there are certain algorithms from which MaxMin and MinMin are used mostly, however these algorithms has disadvantage of starvation. We are proposing an algorithm for implementation of Heuristics MaxMin algorithm using multi-level queue for improving the performance of Task Assignment.
